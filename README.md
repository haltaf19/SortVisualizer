# Sorting Visualizer
A Sorting Visualizer implemented using C# and Windows Forms Application.

The application visualizes an array of unsorted integers as bars. Each bar has a height corresponding to the value at that position in the array. From here, the array is sorted and the bars indicate  movement of the integers within the array throughout the sorting algorithm.
<br/> <br/>
The following algorithms have been implemented into the application:

* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort


More algorithms to be added in the future!
